# zigx-lang

The language server is not really priority right now since the zigx document parsing is not even completed.

Sooo all the code writing here is for highlighting and 100% AI generated.

The rest of the zigx project wasn't created using AI and when the language server is in the works it will be rewritten by yours truly :)
